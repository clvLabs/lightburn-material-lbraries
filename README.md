## Material naming

* Words should be separated by `-`.
* The first word should define the material type.
* Following words should define extra material characteristics.
* `std` is used as shortcut for _standard_.

Some examples:
* `acrylic-clear`
* `wood-ply-std`
* `wood-mdf`
* `cardboard-corrugated-std`
